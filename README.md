# Web Applications Course Project

This project is part of the System Design Project for the Web Applications course (2023/2024). The objective is to develop a comprehensive blueprint for a mobile application, covering both the front-end and back-end architectures. The project emphasizes architectural issues and includes systems architecture, software architecture, and application architecture.

## Goals

1. **Develop a blueprint for a mobile application** that includes all necessary architectural decisions.
2. **Adopt a microservices architecture** for the back-end.
3. **Adopt a micro-frontend architecture** for the front-end.
4. **Implement a single-page application** approach.
5. **Utilize an everything-as-a-service approach** to maximize modularity and reusability.

## Key Features

1. **Systems Architecture**:
    - Definition of the overall structure and high-level components of the system.
    - Identification of external dependencies and interactions.

2. **Software Architecture**:
    - Detailed design of the microservices architecture for the back-end.
    - Detailed design of the micro-frontend architecture for the front-end.
    - Specification of communication protocols and data exchange formats.

3. **Application Architecture**:
    - Blueprint for the single-page application.
    - Considerations for user interface and user experience design.
    - Integration of the front-end and back-end components.

## Project Components

- **Back-end**:
  - Microservices architecture ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
  - Services designed to handle specific business functionalities.
  - Use of APIs to facilitate communication between services.

- **Front-end**:
  - Micro-frontend architecture allowing independent development and deployment of front-end components.
  - Single-page application (SPA) design for a seamless user experience.
  - Utilization of modern front-end frameworks and libraries.
