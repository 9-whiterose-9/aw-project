##  Meat Statistical Data Microfrontend

### Responsability 
- Displaying statistical data related to meat consumption and prodution in the user's region.

### Why it should be a microfrontend
- This microfrontend focuses solely on presenting statistical data, keeping its codebase simple and manageable.
-  Its single responsibility is to handle the presentation of statistical data, ensuring clear separation of concerns.
- The statistical data component can be reused in other applications or pages where similar data presentation is required.
- Can be deployed independently, allowing for updates and changes to the statistical data without affecting other parts of the application.
-  A dedicated team can manage the statistical data microfrontend, enabling quick responses to data updates and user requirements.
-  Provides a vertical service layer specifically for displaying statistical data related to meat consumption.

### Suggestions of improvement
Can be customized to include different data visualization options, filters, or comparative analysis features without impacting other parts of the application.
